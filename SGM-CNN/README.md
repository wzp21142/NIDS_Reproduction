# (3) NIDS execution process

1. Data preprocessing and feature selection. Different datasets have slightly different data preprocessing processes.
2. Imbalance processing. Contains five types of imbalanced processing technologies, namely ROS, SMOTE, ADASYN, RUS + SMOTE,K-means + SMOTE and SGM. 
3. Classification decision. Contains three classification algorithms, namely RF, MLP and CNN.
